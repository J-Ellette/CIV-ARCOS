CIV-ARCOS needs a front-end representation for every already included module, and new modules, scripts, codes, even if it is just a page that lists the function, use, usage, etc.
All should be incorporated into the current web gui that is used for repo url scanning, assessment, and badge issuance. Expand that page to accomodate the additions.
Any forward facing elements will need follow the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS), found at: https://designsystem.digital.gov/ 

The following items will need to be emulated, recreated and built into into CIV-ARCOS (Add as Modules, scripts, etc, or integral to the software). Not standalone features, per se, but as extensions of CIV-ARCOS core functionality - using 100% homegrown code. Regardless of their possible intended use, they will need to be implemented to work towards the Certification Of Software via scanning, looking for week points, whatever their strong suit is.

Before using publically available scripts for this build, we will look to: https://github.com/J-Ellette/Emu-Soft for a script that we made, that does the same thing, 
If there isn't one, we will first determine if we can make it by emulating and recreating it, and do so if possible.
Any newly created, recreated, emulated software will also need to be copied https://github.com/J-Ellette/Emu-Soft/tree/main in the appropriate folder, with readme, ect. following the existing standards of that repo.

Skip redundancies if I have double listed, or already integrated something into CIV-ARCOS. 
When complete with each round of implementation, update this md to note the item as (COMPLETE)

Work through one or more at a time, and then mark each item as (COMPLETE) once you are done implementing them.

## CIV-SCAP: (COMPLETE)
Automated compliance content and protocols.
(https://github.com/usnistgov/SCAP)
## SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) - NIST automated security compliance: SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a suite of specifications developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to standardize and automate security management, vulnerability management, and policy compliance evaluation for computer systems. It aims to promote a standardized approach to implementing automated security mechanisms. Purpose and function Standardization: SCAP standardizes the format and naming conventions for communicating information about software flaws and security configurations. This allows security tools from different vendors to work together and share data more easily. Automation: By defining machine-readable content, SCAP enables consistent automation and reporting across different products and environments. This includes automated vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and security assessments. Compliance: SCAP supports compliance with security regulations and frameworks, such as FISMA (Federal Information Security Modernization Act) and NIST SP 800-53. It provides checklists that link computer security configurations to the controls in SP 800-53. Vulnerability management: SCAP is used for vulnerability measurement and scoring by integrating with standards like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). This helps organizations prioritize remediation efforts. Continuous monitoring: SCAP supports continuous monitoring of security settings to ensure systems remain compliant over time. Key components SCAP is made up of several open standards that work together. Some key specifications include: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): Standard identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Common Platform Enumeration (CPE): A standardized naming scheme for hardware, operating systems, and applications. Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF): A language for creating machine-readable security checklists, benchmarks, and configuration policies. Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL): A language for encoding system details and assessing systems for the presence of specific security states, such as a vulnerability or configuration issue. Benefits of using SCAP Minimizes human error: Automating security evaluation and management reduces the risk of human error during compliance assessments. Cost savings: By automating processes, SCAP helps reduce the costs associated with manual labor and the potential expenses from security breaches. Improved security posture: The use of standardized and automated checks helps organizations identify and address vulnerabilities more effectively. Increased efficiency: Automation frees up security personnel to focus on other tasks. Example implementation OpenSCAP is a collection of open-source tools that provide a standardized solution for security compliance and vulnerability management, leveraging SCAP standards. It can be used to scan systems for vulnerabilities, check configurations, and generate reports.

## CIV-BSIITGrundschutz: (COMPLETE)
Systematic security certification methodology.
(https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud/compliance/it-grundschutz)
### BSI IT-Grundschutz - German federal IT security certification: BSI IT-Grundschutz is a German framework for information security, developed by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which guides organizations in implementing a medium level of security for their IT systems. It is a set of standardized procedures and catalogues that includes technical, organizational, and personnel security measures. Certification is achieved by implementing a management system, often based on the ISO 27001 standard, and can be confirmed by an ISO 27001 certificate based on IT-Grundschutz. Key aspects of BSI IT-Grundschutz Comprehensive security: It provides a framework of technical, organizational, and personnel security measures to protect IT systems. Standardized approach: The BSI develops standards and catalogues that define threats and safeguards for common business environments. Risk-based methodology: The framework includes a risk-related methodology to help organizations tailor their security measures to their specific needs and risks. Modular and customizable: Organizations can use the modular approach of IT-Grundschutz to implement security in a way that fits their specific situation. Certification: Successful implementation can lead to an ISO 27001 certification, which is a widely recognized international standard for information security management systems. Personal certifications: The BSI also offers personal certifications for consultants who can help organizations implement IT-Grundschutz. How it works Information Security Management System (ISMS): Organizations must first set up an ISMS, which is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information. The BSI standard 200-1 is based on ISO/IEC 27001 for this purpose. IT structure analysis: A detailed analysis of the company's IT infrastructure and processes is required to document the existing setup. Implementation of security measures: Based on the analysis and the IT-Grundschutz Catalogues, technical, organizational, and personnel security measures are implemented to mitigate identified risks. Certification: After implementing the necessary security measures and management system, the organization can undergo an audit to receive a certification, such as the ISO 27001 certificate based on IT-Grundschutz.

## CIV-ACAS: (COMPLETE)
Repo vulnerability scanner.

## ACAS (Assured Compliance Assessment Solution) - DISA vulnerability scanning: ACAS (Assured Compliance Assessment Solution) is a suite of tools used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for vulnerability scanning and compliance assessments, with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) overseeing its deployment. It primarily uses Tenable's Nessus for active vulnerability scanning, SecurityCenter (now Tenable.sc) for management and analysis, and Nessus Network Monitor for passive monitoring to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and ensure systems meet security policies. How ACAS works for DISA vulnerability scanning Unified platform: ACAS provides a unified approach to vulnerability and compliance assessment across the DoD's network, which manages millions of devices. Core components: The suite's main components include: Nessus Scanners: Perform active, credentialed, or agentless scans to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities on systems. Security Center (Tenable.sc): Centralizes scan data, provides reporting, allows for risk-based prioritization, and helps manage the overall security posture. Nessus Network Monitor (formerly Passive Vulnerability Scanner): Continuously monitors network traffic to detect vulnerabilities without active scanning, which is crucial for mobile assets. Functionality: ACAS automates the process of: Vulnerability scanning: Identifying software vulnerabilities, missing patches, and other weaknesses. Compliance assessment: Ensuring systems are configured according to DoD security policies and regulations. Continuous monitoring: Providing ongoing visibility into the security posture to quickly address new threats. Reporting and auditing: Generating automated reports for leadership and auditors to assess risk and track remediation efforts. ACAS and Nessus Relationship: The ACAS program is powered by Tenable's software, so ACAS is essentially the DoD's implementation of Tenable's vulnerability management tools. Enterprise license: DISA holds an enterprise license for Tenable's products, providing the software suite to all DoD agencies. Software updates: While DISA has its own specific built assets and policies, the core software used in the ACAS program is identical to the commercial versions of the Tenable products.

### Accelerated Authority to Operate (ATO) (COMPLETE)
DoD's fast-track software approval process
The DoD's Accelerated Authority to Operate (ATO) is a fast-track process, like the new Software Fast Track (SWFT) Initiative, that aims to significantly reduce the time it takes to approve and deploy software. These initiatives use an AI-enabled, continuous monitoring model, a security baseline, and risk-based decisions to automate security authorization, moving away from the traditional, manual Risk Management Framework (RMF). By focusing on continuous compliance and operationally relevant risk, the goal is to allow for rapid deployment while still maintaining an acceptable level of security. 
How it works
AI-enabled and automated: The new process uses artificial intelligence to automate many parts of the compliance and security review, replacing manual oversight with real-time, machine-supported evaluations.
Focus on continuous monitoring: Instead of a single snapshot in time, the system continuously monitors security and compliance, allowing for ongoing authorization (cATO).
Risk-based decisions: Authorizing officials make decisions based on key elements like a cybersecurity baseline, a penetration test, and a continuous monitoring strategy, allowing them to accept certain low risks if there's a plan to fix them.
Leverages other initiatives: The accelerated process is often integrated with other DoD efforts, such as the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) and DevSecOps principles. 
Goals and benefits
Accelerated deployment: The primary goal is to reduce the time it takes to get software authorized and deployed, from months or years down to days or weeks.
Improved security: By focusing on modern approaches, automating checks, and standardizing bug bounties, the aim is to improve overall cyber hygiene.
Increased agility: It allows the DoD to keep pace with private sector innovation by developing and deploying software more quickly and iteratively.
Cultural shift: The initiative promotes a cultural shift towards integrating security early in the development lifecycle (security-by-design).

It helps organizations protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information assets through a systematic, risk-based approach that includes identifying threats, implementing controls, and monitoring performance. 
Key components and goals
ISMS framework: The standard provides a framework for managing information security risks by setting an ISMS policy and objectives, and implementing necessary controls.
Risk management: A core principle is a risk-based approach, where an organization identifies, assesses, and treats information security risks to protect sensitive data.
CIA triad: ISO 27001 is based on the CIA triad, which focuses on:
Confidentiality: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
Integrity: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information.
Availability: Ensuring authorized users can access information when needed.
Continuous improvement: The standard emphasizes a continuous cycle of implementing, monitoring, and improving the ISMS to ensure ongoing security. 
Benefits of ISO 27001
Demonstrates trust: Certification shows customers, partners, and regulators that the organization takes information security seriously.
Reduces risk: By managing risks and implementing controls, organizations can avoid the financial and reputational damage of security breaches.
Supports compliance: It helps organizations meet legal and regulatory requirements, such as the GDPR. 
Getting certified
An organization must have an independent, accredited body perform a Stage 1 and Stage 2 audit to confirm its ISMS meets the requirements.
The cost and time frame for certification can vary based on the company's size and the scope of the ISMS.
The ISO 27001:2022 version was released in October 2022, and organizations certified under the previous version must transition by October 31, 2025.
