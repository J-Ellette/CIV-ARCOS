# CIV-ARCOS Build Guide

## Project Overview

We are laying the foundation to build a "civilian" version of military-grade software assurance, while following proven ARCOS methodologies - perfect for open source projects, enterprise development teams, or as a SaaS offering. We will be creating the various parts of the system by emulating and perfecting existing technologies.

## Technologies We Will NOT Use

We won't be using the following technologies, but will take inspiration from and emulate them:
- Django
- FastAPI
- Flask
- Django ORM
- SQLAlchemy
- Peewee/Tortoise - Lighter ORMs
- Django-allauth
- Authlib
- PassLib
- Django Templates
- Jinja2
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Pydantic
- Django Cache Framework
- Redis-py / aioredis
- Django Admin
- Flask-Admin
- Django Security Middleware

## Technologies We Can Use

We will still use, if we need to, and if unable to emulate:
- pytest
- Coverage.py
- Black - Code Formatter
- MyPy - Type Checking
- Flake8 - Linting
- Docker

## Starting Base: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Start with:
- GitHub integration for code analysis
- Basic test coverage tracking
- Simple badge generation (test coverage + basic quality metrics)
- Web dashboard for viewing quality arguments
- REST API for badge embedding

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Evidence Collection Engine

Build a system similar to RACK (Rapid Assurance Curation Kit) - a semantic triplestore that normalizes and organizes evidence from different tools and formats while maintaining data provenance.

**Reference:** [RACK GitHub](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK) - Arcos-tools

**Implementation approach:**
- Create a graph database (inspiration: Neo4j or Apache Jena) for storing evidence relationships.
- Create adapters for popular development tools (GitHub, SonarQube, Jest, PyTest, etc.).
- Implement data provenance tracking with blockchain-like immutable audit trails.

### Step 2: Automated Test Evidence Generation

Follow GrammaTech's approach: enable automated test generation, execution, and test-suite maintenance to achieve measurably improved test coverage and completeness.

**Reference:** [GrammaTech](https://www.grammatech.com/) - International Defense Security & Technology

**Key components:**
- **Static Analysis Module:** Emulate and create tools like ESLint, Pylint, SonarQube.
- **Dynamic Testing:** Automated unit test generation using AI (similar to GitHub Copilot for tests, or local like ollama), or purely code driven - decided by user.
- **Coverage Analysis:** Track code coverage, branch coverage, mutation testing scores.
- **Security Scanning:** SAST/DAST integration with tools like CodeQL, Semgrep.

### Step 3: Digital Assurance Case Builder

Implement CertGATE-style Digital Assurance Cases (DACs) that automatically construct arguments from evidence using standard formalisms and templates.

**Reference:** [CertGATE](https://arcos-tools.org/tools/certgate) - AIAA/ACM Digital Library

**Technical implementation:**
- **Argument Templates:** Create reusable patterns for common quality arguments.
- **Evidence Linking:** Automatically connect test results, coverage data, and analysis to argument nodes.
- **GSN (Goal Structuring Notation):** Use established notation for visual argument representation.
- **Pattern Instantiation:** Auto-generate argument structures based on project type.

### Step 4: Quality Badge System

**Badge Categories:**
- Test Coverage (Bronze: >60%, Silver: >80%, Gold: >95%)
- Security Assurance (vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis)
- Code Quality (complexity metrics, maintainability index)
- Documentation (API docs, README quality, inline comments)
- Performance (load testing, profiling results)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance for web apps)

## Implementation Stack

### Backend Architecture

Core stack recommendation:
- Emulate and recreate FastAPI or Django REST for API layer
- Emulate and recreate Neo4j for evidence graph storage
- Emulate and recreate PostgreSQL for metadata and user management
- Emulate and recreate Redis for caching and real-time updates
- Emulate and recreate Celery for background evidence processing

### Evidence Collection Pipeline

Example evidence collector structure:

```python
class EvidenceCollector:
    def collect_from_github(self, repo_url, commit_hash):
        # Pull code metrics, commit history, PR reviews
    
    def collect_from_ci(self, build_id):
        # Test results, coverage reports, performance metrics
    
    def collect_from_security_tools(self, scan_results):
        # Vulnerability reports, dependency analysis
```

### Assurance Case Engine

Follow NASA's AdvoCATE approach: automated pattern instantiation, hierarchical abstraction, and integration of formal methods into wider assurance arguments.

**Reference:** ResearchGate

```python
class AssuranceCase:
    def __init__(self, project):
        self.goals = []  # Top-level quality goals
        self.strategies = []  # How goals are broken down
        self.evidence = []  # Supporting evidence
        
    def auto_generate_from_template(self, template_type):
        # Generate case structure based on project type
        # Web app, mobile app, API, library, etc.
```

## Specific Technical Features

### 1. Real-time Quality Monitoring

- WebSocket connections for live quality score updates
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Automated evidence collection on every commit

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis

Implement AI-driven test case generation and quality assessment similar to TestGeniusAI approaches:
- Use LLMs to analyze code and suggest missing tests
- Generate quality improvement recommendations
- Predict quality risks based on code changes
- Use code driven architecture when LLM not available or desired

### 3. Blockchain Evidence Integrity

Follow Guardtime Federal's approach: use blockchain technology to secure the integrity of evidence data.

**Reference:** International Defense Security & Technology

- Immutable evidence timestamps
- Cryptographic proof of evidence authenticity
- Tamper-evident audit trails

### 4. Integration APIs

Example integration points:

```javascript
const qualityBadges = {
  github: {
    webhook: '/api/github/quality-check',
    badge_url: '/api/badge/{repo}/{branch}'
  },
  slack: {
    notifications: '/api/slack/quality-alerts'
  },
  jira: {
    quality_tickets: '/api/jira/quality-issues'
  }
}
```
