# Build Documentation

This directory contains all the step-by-step implementation guides and summaries for the CIV-ARCOS project.

## Contents

### Build Guide
- **build-guide.md** - Main build guide outlining the entire project structure, technologies emulated, and implementation roadmap

### Implementation Summaries
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - High-level summary of completed implementations and architecture decisions

### Step-by-Step Completion Guides

Each STEP*.md file documents the completion of a specific phase of the project:

- **STEP2_COMPLETE.md** - Initial setup and foundation
- **STEP3_COMPLETE.md** - Digital Assurance Case Builder
- **STEP4_COMPLETE.md** - Core implementation phase
- **STEP4.2_COMPLETE.md** - Advanced ARCOS Methodologies (CertGATE, CLARISSA, A-CERT, CAID-tools)
- **STEP5_COMPLETE.md** - Backend architecture (Redis, Celery, web framework emulations)
- **STEP5.5_COMPLETE.md** - Additional features and integrations
- **STEP5_6_COMPLETE.md** - Continued enhancements
- **STEP5_ENTERPRISE_COMPLETE.md** - Enterprise features
- **STEP7_COMPLETE.md** - Advanced capabilities
- **STEP8_COMPLETE.md** - DevSecOps expansion
- **STEP9_COMPLETE.md** - Visualization and reporting
- **STEP10_COMPLETE.md** - Plugin SDK and developer tools

### Special Topics
- **I18N_DIGITALTWIN_COMPLETE.md** - Internationalization and Digital Twin integration documentation

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
1. **Historical record** of implementation decisions and progress
2. **Technical reference** for understanding the architecture and design choices
3. **Onboarding material** for new contributors to understand the project evolution
4. **Compliance documentation** showing adherence to ARCOS methodologies
