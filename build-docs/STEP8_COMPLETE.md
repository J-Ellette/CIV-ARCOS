interactive_gsn = viewer.generate_interactive_gsn(
    assurance_case,
    include_metadata=True,
    enable_drill_down=True
)

# Create evidence timeline
timeline = viewer.create_evidence_timeline(evidence_items)

# Export to HTML
html = viewer.export_to_format(assurance_case, "html")

# Create dashboards
dashboard = QualityDashboard()
exec_dashboard = dashboard.create_executive_dashboard(org_data)
dev_dashboard = dashboard.create_developer_dashboard(team_data)
```
