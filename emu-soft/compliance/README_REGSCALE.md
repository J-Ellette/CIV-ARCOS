# RegScale Compliance as Code Module

## Overview
Compliance as code platform that integrates compliance into IT operations, allowing continuous monitoring and automated reporting against federal standards like NIST 800-53 and FedRAMP.

## Purpose
Automates compliance management by treating compliance requirements as code, enabling continuous compliance monitoring and automated evidence collection.

## Supported Frameworks
- **NIST 800-53 Rev 5**: 1,189 controls across 20 families
- **FedRAMP**: Low, Moderate, and High baselines
- **CMMC 2.0**: Levels 1, 2, and 3
- **PCI DSS 4.0**: 12 requirements
- **HIPAA Security Rule**: Administrative, Physical, and Technical safeguards
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**: 93 Annex A controls

## Key Features

### 1. Compliance as Code
- Define compliance controls as executable code
- Version control for compliance requirements
- Automated testing of control implementation
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) integration

### 2. Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time compliance status tracking
- Automated compliance checks
- Drift detection and alerting
- Configurable monitoring frequency (hourly/daily/weekly)

### 3. Automated Assessments
- Full, incremental, and targeted assessments
- Automated control testing
- Immediate results (45 seconds typical)
- Historical trend analysis

### 4. Automated Reporting
- Executive summaries
- Technical reports
- Audit-ready documentation
- Multiple export formats (JSON, PDF, Excel, HTML)

### 5. Integration Capabilities
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Cloud infrastructure monitoring
- Security tool integration
- Alert channels (email, Slack, webhook)

## Usage

### Create Compliance Project
```python
from regscale import RegScalePlatform

regscale = RegScalePlatform()

project = regscale.create_compliance_project(
    project_name="Enterprise Cloud Compliance",
    frameworks=["nist_800_53", "fedramp", "iso_27001"],
    organization="ACME Corporation",
    scope="All production cloud infrastructure"
)
```

### Define Control as Code
```python
control = regscale.define_control_as_code(
    project_id=project["project_id"],
    control_id="AC-2",
    framework="nist_800_53",
    automation_script="""
    # Check user account management
    check_account_creation_process()
    verify_account_review_schedule()
    validate_account_termination()
    """,
    test_criteria={
        "account_creation": "automated",
        "review_frequency": "quarterly",
        "termination_process": "within_24_hours"
    }
)
```

### Run Automated Assessment
```python
assessment = regscale.run_automated_assessment(
    project_id=project["project_id"],
    assessment_type="full"  # full, incremental, targeted
)

print(f"Compliance Score: {assessment['compliance_score']}%")
print(f"Passed: {assessment['passed']}")
print(f"Failed: {assessment['failed']}")
print(f"Duration: {assessment['duration_seconds']}s")
```

### Enable Continuous Monitoring
```python
monitoring = regscale.enable_continuous_monitoring(
    project_id=project["project_id"],
    monitoring_frequency="hourly",
    alert_threshold=95  # Alert if compliance drops below 95%
)
```

### Generate Automated Report
```python
# Executive Report
executive_report = regscale.generate_automated_report(
    project_id=project["project_id"],
    report_type="executive",
    frameworks=["nist_800_53", "fedramp"]
)

# Technical Report
technical_report = regscale.generate_automated_report(
    project_id=project["project_id"],
    report_type="technical"
)

# Audit Report
audit_report = regscale.generate_automated_report(
    project_id=project["project_id"],
    report_type="audit"
)
```
