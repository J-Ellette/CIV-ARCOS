# FedRAMP Compliance Module

## Overview
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliance module for cloud service provider authorization.

## Purpose
Provides standardized security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring capabilities for cloud products and services used by U.S. federal agencies.

## Features

### Impact Levels
- **Low Impact**: 125 controls (NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Low baseline)
- **Moderate Impact**: 325 controls (NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Moderate baseline)
- **High Impact**: 421 controls (NIST 800-53 Rev 5 High baseline)
- **Low Impact SaaS**: 130 controls (Tailored baseline for SaaS applications)

### Authorization Paths
1. **JAB P-ATO**: Joint Authorization Board Provisional Authority to Operate
2. **Agency ATO**: Individual agency authorization
3. **CSP Supplied**: Cloud Service Provider supplied package

### Key Capabilities
- Authorization package creation and management
- Security assessment by 3PAO (Third-Party Assessment Organization)
- Authority to Operate (ATO) granting and tracking
- Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) deliverables
- FedRAMP Marketplace listing management

## Usage

### Create Authorization Package
```python
from fedramp import FedRAMPAuthorization

fedramp = FedRAMPAuthorization()

package = fedramp.create_authorization_package(
    csp_name="Example Cloud Services",
    service_name="Enterprise Cloud Platform",
    service_model="IaaS",
    deployment_model="public",
    impact_level="moderate",
    authorization_path="agency"
)
```

### Conduct Security Assessment
```python
assessment = fedramp.conduct_security_assessment(
    package_id=package["package_id"],
    assessor_org="Certified 3PAO Inc.",
    assessment_type="full"
)
```

### Grant Authority to Operate
```python
ato = fedramp.grant_authority_to_operate(
    package_id=package["package_id"],
    authorizing_official="Chief Information Security Officer",
    ato_type="ATO",
    expiration_months=36
)
```

### Submit Continuous Monitoring
```python
conmon = fedramp.submit_conmon_deliverable(
    package_id=package["package_id"],
    deliverable_type="scan_report",
    deliverable_data={
        "scan_date": "2024-11-01",
        "vulnerabilities_found": 5,
        "critical": 0,
        "high": 2,
        "medium": 3
    }
)
