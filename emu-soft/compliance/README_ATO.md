# Accelerated Authority to Operate (ATO)

**DoD's fast-track software approval process for rapid deployment**

## Overview

This module implements the Accelerated Authority to Operate (ATO) process, enabling rapid software authorization from months to days/weeks through AI-enabled continuous monitoring, automated assessments, and risk-based decisions.

## Features

- **Automated Baseline Assessment**: NIST 800-53 security control generation
- **AI-Enabled Risk Analysis**: Intelligent risk assessment using likelihood x impact matrices
- **Continuous ATO (cATO)**: Ongoing authorization through continuous monitoring
- **Rapid Decision Making**: Risk-based authorization decisions
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Seamless integration with development pipelines

## Components

### ATOManager
Main interface for managing the ATO process.

### BaselineGenerator
Generates security baseline controls following NIST 800-53 control families (AC, AU, AT, CM, CP, IA, IR, MA, MP, PE, PL, PS, RA, CA, SC, SI, SA).

### RiskAssessor
Performs automated risk assessment using likelihood x impact matrices.

## Usage

```python
from ato import ATOManager, AssessmentType

manager = ATOManager()

# 1. Initiate ATO
package = manager.initiate_ato(
    system_name="SecureApp",
    system_version="1.0.0",
    impact_level="moderate"
)

# 2. Conduct assessment
assessment = manager.conduct_assessment(
    system_name="SecureApp",
    assessment_type=AssessmentType.BASELINE,
    vulnerabilities=[...]
)

# 3. Make authorization decision
final_package = manager.make_authorization_decision(
    system_name="SecureApp",
    authorizing_official="Security Officer"
)

# 4. Enable continuous ATO
manager.enable_continuous_ato("SecureApp")
```

## Authorization Levels

- **FULL**: Complete authorization for production use
- **INTERIM**: Temporary authorization (6 months)
- **CONDITIONAL**: Authorization with conditions/POA&Ms
- **DENIED**: Authorization denied

## Risk Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required
- **HIGH**: Urgent remediation needed
- **MODERATE**: Planned remediation
- **LOW**: Monitor and address as resources allow
- **MINIMAL**: Informational

## API Integration

```bash
# Initiate ATO
POST /api/ato/initiate
{
  "system_name": "MyApp",
  "system_version": "1.0.0",
  "impact_level": "moderate"
}

# Conduct Assessment
POST /api/ato/assess
{
  "system_name": "MyApp",
  "assessment_type": "baseline",
  "vulnerabilities": [...]
}

# Get Status
GET /api/ato/status/{system_name}
```
