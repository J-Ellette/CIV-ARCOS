## Usage

### Create Cloud Assessment
```python
from cloud_compliance import CloudComplianceManager

cloud = CloudComplianceManager()

assessment = cloud.create_cloud_assessment(
    cloud_provider="aws",
    account_id="123456789012",
    environment="production",
    service_model="iaas",
    target_compliance=["fedramp", "pci_dss", "hipaa"]
)
```

### Scan Cloud Resources
```python
scan_results = cloud.scan_cloud_resources(
    assessment_id=assessment["assessment_id"],
    resource_inventory={
        "count": 250,
        "types": ["EC2", "S3", "RDS", "Lambda"],
        "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
    }
)
```

### Generate Compliance Report
```python
# Executive summary for leadership
executive_report = cloud.generate_compliance_report(
    assessment_id=assessment["assessment_id"],
    report_format="executive"
)

# Technical details for engineers
technical_report = cloud.generate_compliance_report(
    assessment_id=assessment["assessment_id"],
    report_format="technical"
)

# Detailed audit report
detailed_report = cloud.generate_compliance_report(
    assessment_id=assessment["assessment_id"],
    report_format="detailed"
)
```

### Register Workload
```python
workload = cloud.register_workload(
    workload_name="Customer Database",
    cloud_provider="azure",
    service_model="paas",
    compliance_requirements=["hipaa", "gdpr", "iso_27001"],
    data_classification="restricted"
)
```

### Enable Continuous Compliance

continuous = cloud.enable_continuous_compliance(
    workload_id=workload["workload_id"],
    monitoring_frequency="daily"
)
```

### Get Provider Certifications
```python
aws_certs = cloud.get_provider_certifications("aws")
azure_certs = cloud.get_provider_certifications("azure")
