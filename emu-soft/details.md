# Emulated Software and Scripts

This directory contains copies of software, scripts, and code that were created by emulating existing tools and technologies. Each component was built from scratch without using the original external dependencies, following the principle of creating a self-contained civilian version of military-grade software assurance.

## Organization

Components are organized into subdirectories by category:

- **`analysis/`** - Code analysis and quality assessment tools
- **`assurance/`** - ARCOS assurance case components (DARPA-inspired)
- **`evidence/`** - Evidence collection and provenance tracking
- **`infrastructure/`** - Core infrastructure (cache, tasks, web, database)
- **`web/`** - Web components and visualization tools

Each subdirectory contains a detailed README.md with usage examples, API documentation, and integration guides.

**Original location:** `civ_arcos/web/dashboard.py`

## ARCOS Methodology Emulations (Step 4.2)

These components emulate advanced ARCOS (Automated Rapid Certification of Software) tools developed for DARPA and used in military-grade software assurance.

## Assurance Case Components

### 10. assurance/fragments.py - CertGATE Assurance Case Fragments
**Emulates:** CertGATE (part of ARCOS toolset)  
**What it does:** Provides self-contained arguments for individual components or subsystems (Assurance Case Fragments). These fragments can be linked to evidence artifacts, giving continuous feedback on certifiability strengths and weaknesses throughout the development lifecycle. Supports pattern-based fragment creation, evidence linking, strength assessment, and fragment composition.  
**Original location:** `civ_arcos/assurance/fragments.py`

### 11. assurance/argtl.py - Argument Transformation Language
**Emulates:** ArgTL from CertGATE  
**What it does:** Domain-specific language (DSL) for assembling and transforming assurance case fragments. Enables composition of fragments into complete assurance cases through operations like compose, decompose, refine, abstract, substitute, link, validate, and merge. Provides scripting capabilities for automated assurance case assembly.  
**Original location:** `civ_arcos/assurance/argtl.py`

### 12. assurance/acql.py - Assurance Case Query Language

## Purpose and Design Philosophy

All components in this directory were created following these principles:

1. **Zero External Dependencies**: Each emulation is self-contained and doesn't require installation of the original tool or service
2. **Civilian Adaptation**: Military-grade methodologies adapted for open source, enterprise, and SaaS use cases
3. **Educational Value**: Clear, readable code that demonstrates the core concepts of each emulated tool
4. **Production Ready**: Not just prototypes - these are fully functional implementations used throughout CIV-ARCOS
5. **Extensibility**: Designed to be extended and customized for specific organizational needs

## For Future Additions

When creating new emulations, add them to this directory and document:
- **Name and filename**
- **What it emulates**
- **What it does** (detailed functionality description)
- **Original location** in the codebase

This maintains a clear record of all emulated software for reference, compliance, and licensing purposes.

## License and Attribution

These emulations were created as part of the CIV-ARCOS project. While they emulate the functionality of existing tools, they are original implementations written from scratch. The concepts and methodologies of ARCOS tools (CertGATE, CLARISSA, A-CERT, CAID-tools) are attributed to their original creators at Adventium Labs and were developed under DARPA contracts. Our implementations are civilian adaptations inspired by their public documentation and research papers.
